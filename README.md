## About
These themes are designed to be consistent with the corresponding [Greylooks GTK2/3](https://github.com/vbrand1984/greylooks) themes, so it's better to use them together.

Also, check my [vim syntax highlighting plugin for Openbox themes](https://github.com/vbrand1984/ob3-vim-syntax), if you're interested in creating and modifying these themes.

## Version history
# 2026-01-04 Update
1. Color hues were slightly changed while preserving the whole idea, vibe and atmosphere of the theme.
2. Purple and Sand colour variants are added.
3. Window titlebars are now coloured for the vanilla Greylooks Openbox theme pack.
4. Actual theme version with flat (non-coloured) window titlebars is now available in a [separate repository `flatlooks-openbox`](https://github.com/vbrand1984/flatlooks-openbox).

## Author
The author of the `themerc` files is Victor Brand. Button assets are borrowed elsewhere, mostly from the [BunsenLabs](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-themes
), and also from the *Bear2* theme.

## Usage
Just install the theme directories into your `/usr/share/themes` (for systemwide installation) or `~/.local/share/themes` (for local install) directory.
